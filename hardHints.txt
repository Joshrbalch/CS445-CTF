HINTS:
	1) Try and figure out what language this was compiled with. 
	Maybe looking at the text of the binary could help you out here.


	2) Ghidra is a great tool for reverse engineering because it allows you to install extensions.
	Try finding an extension that will analyze binaries that were written in the language you found.
	It's still a little messy looking, but a lot better to look at. Check some of the decompiled
	functions, there's a lot of junk, but trying looking at functions that start with "m"
