Name: "What's the password?"
Points: 125pts

You are given a password manager software that holds the admin password for the system. Previous reverse
engineers have attempted to break in by trying to find the password, but have failed. It is up to you to recover
the admin password and save the company. All others attemped to find the password and have failed, will you take
a differet approach? Knowledge of decompilation will be needed to search for what others may have missed.

P.S. you are finding the admin password, not the password to the password manager.


Hints:

1. The flag is encrypted....
2. Disassemble the exe and search for clues....
