There are many ways to solve this problem, and they all begin with realizing that the
password is a red hering. There is no password. However the developers did not take security into 
mind and have left some very big flaws in the security of this password manager. The most simple way to solve this
would be to open the exe in IDAfreeware, and view the strings of the program. Here one will see two interesting clues,
one is "Salad3". This may seem like a flag, but if one would look at this hints, it says the flag is encrypted.
"Salad3" is a hint to the encryption method used on the flag. I wonder how salad has to do with cryptology?
"Salad3" hints towards a caeser cypher and 3 is the offset. With this in mind, one can use a caeser cypher on
the encrypted string to find the admin password.
